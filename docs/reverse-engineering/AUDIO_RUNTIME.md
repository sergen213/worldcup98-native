# Audio runtime — streaming model of FIFAWC.EXE (measured 2026-11-01)

Consolidates the audio data-path facts recovered across Ghidra passes and the 2026-11-01
speech-decode session. Companion docs: [GHIDRA_PASS2_AUDIO.md](GHIDRA_PASS2_AUDIO.md)
(now carries a correction banner), [AUDIO.md](../asset-formats/AUDIO.md) (container/codec
formats). Raw decompiles live outside the repo under `analysis/pass3/` (non-distributed);
this doc records addresses and structure only. All `FUN_…`/`DAT_…` names are Ghidra defaults.

## 1. PE layout of FIFAWC.EXE (measured from the section table)

| Section | VA | Raw offset | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| imagebase | `0x400000` | — | — |
| AUTO | `0x401000` | `0x400` | `0x157000` |
| .idata | `0x558000` | `0x157400` | `0x1200` |
| DGROUP | `0x55a000` | `0x158600` | rawsize `0x3d600` (**VirtualSize = 0** in the optional header) |
| .bss | `0x598000` | — | — |
| .reloc | `0x676000` | — | — |

## 2. Ghidra pitfall: DGROUP `VirtualSize = 0`

Because the optional header declares DGROUP's VirtualSize as 0, Ghidra treats the whole
section (VA `0x55a000`–`0x597600`, initialized file bytes at raw `0x158600`+) as
**uninitialized**, so `Memory.findBytes` skips it — string searches silently miss every
string in DGROUP, and "no xrefs found" conclusions drawn that way are false negatives.

Recipe: resolve strings in this range via **explicit VAs**, not memory scans. Worked example:
the source-path string `cmn\sspeech.c` sits at VA `0x56ae14`, the `SNDspeechinit` message
strings around `0x56ae24`+; a pointer scan over initialized bytes found speech-module
pointer users clustered in the `FUN_004df8xx`–`FUN_004e6xxx` region.

## 3. cmn_stream reader: `'lECs'` chunk framing

Region `0x42bb54–0x42d0bb` is the EA **cmn_stream** reader — NOT a MicroTalk CELP decoder
(the pass-2 claim; see the correction banner in GHIDRA_PASS2_AUDIO.md). Identifying features:

- Chunk magic `'lECs'`: byteswapped compare against `0x5343456c` (i.e. `ScEl`/`lECs` record
  framing of the EA audio library, cf. debug blob `D:\audio\lib\win\sdirect.c`).
- Ring refill loop feeding fixed-size slots.
- Codec dispatch at `stream+0x94`, case ids `0xd`, `0x14`, `0x11`, `0x12`, `0x13`.

## 4. Streaming data path (function map)

| Function | Role |
|---|---|
| `FUN_0042e368` | **cmn_stream pump**: parses `.SMP`-style `[u32 BE len][payload]` chunk records into a ring of 16 × 512-byte slots at base `&DAT_005ea540`; slot layout: `+0x0` buffer pointer, `+0xc` read position, `+0x10` total |
| `FUN_0042e290` | FIFO consumer of the ring slots |
| `FUN_0042d5a4` | output buffer set |
| `FUN_00432918` | feed gate — decompiles to a bool "can feed" check: chunk-framed mode iff `DAT_005ff3d4 == 3`; active-voice count from bitmask `DAT_005ff420` via `FUN_0043376c` (popcount) |
| `FUN_004c4af0` / `FUN_004c4890` / `FUN_004c49c0` | cmn_queue length / pop / insert |
| `FUN_0049a900` | allocator used by the queue/stream layer |
| `FUN_00431494` | iSNDserve entry: pops the cmn_queue and sets the stream flag byte at `+0xee` (Run24 report, `analysis/pass3/FIFAWC.EXE_speech.txt`) |
| `FUN_004314d8` | serve loop; checks field `+0x20` before servicing a stream |

Model: speech/SMP data reaches the mixer as chunk-framed records through cmn_stream
(ring of 512-byte slots), streams are queued per voice (cmn_queue + serve entry/loop), and
the feed gate throttles refill by mode byte + active-voice bitmask. Decoding itself is the
`PT`-tagged payload path documented in [AUDIO.md](../asset-formats/AUDIO.md) — no codec
tables were located at, or needed from, the pass-2 claimed VAs: speech decodes fully with
those VAs unmapped and unloaded (measured 2026-11-01).

## 5. Consequences for the port

- `.PBK`/`.SMP` playback needs only the file-level model (PT play track at member offset 20,
  codec tag routing) — not a bit-exact clone of this runtime pump — for offline decode.
- If streaming behavior is reproduced (voice counts, feed gating), use the table above as
  the semantic reference.
